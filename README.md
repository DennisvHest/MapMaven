Map Maven is an application for managing Beat Saber playlists, discovering new maps to play and to improve your Beat Saber skills. With features such as dynamic playlists and a map recommendation system, you will always have great new maps to play in your next Beat Saber session.

# Features
## Playlist Management
Easily create and manage your Beat Saber playlists. You can add, edit, and delete maps from your playlists with just a few clicks.

## Dynamic playlists
Dynamic playlists are playlists that are periodically updated with new maps. For example: a "Recently added maps" playlist always contains the most recently added maps.

## Map recommendation
The "improve" page shows maps that are recommended for you to improve your skills. It recommends maps based on a machine learning model trained on almost every score on ScoreSaber, predicting what accuracy you can get and how much pp you can gain. You can create a playlist with the recommended maps. Maps that you don't have on your PC will be downloaded.

# Installation
## Method 1: Installer (recommended)
Download MapMavenSetup.exe from the [latest release](https://github.com/DennisvHest/MapMaven/releases) and run it. Map Maven will be installed automatically and will download and install future updates.

## Method 2: Downloading zip
Download the zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/DennisvHest/MapMaven/releases) and extract it somewhere on your PC. Run MapMaven.exe to launch Map Maven. Future updates will not be automatically installed.

**Note:** You might get a Windows SmartScreen warning when using either method. You can click 'More info' and then 'Run anyway' to ignore the warning.

# Why BETA?
So far, Map Maven has only been tested by me. The map recommendation system works well for me, and in theory, it should recommend good maps for every Beat Saber player. But there is no way for me to actually know if it recommends good maps to player for other players. Within the BETA, the recommendation system can be improved based on feedback.

There are also some improvements that have to be made to make the application run better.

Also, there are some known [issues](https://github.com/DennisvHest/MapMaven/issues) that have to be resolved.
